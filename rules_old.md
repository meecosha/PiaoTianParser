# Martial Peak Translation Rules
## 1. Tone & Style

* Use clear, natural English that reads smoothly for modern readers.
* Maintain the Classic Xianxia Style:
  * Slightly formal, dramatic, and reverent tone.
  * Avoid slang or overly modern expressions unless present in the original.
  * Translate for understanding, not word-for-word literalness. Use classic xianxia phrases like "courting death, etc."
  * Be especially cautious with the pronouns, so that you don't mix up who does what.
  * Translate all of the chinese characters, don't leave anything untranslated.

## 2. Formatting

* Chapter titles start with `##` to avoid conflict with volume headers (`#`). Keep the name of the chapter in this format: Chapter # — Name of the Chapter
* One blank line between paragraphs and soft scene shifts.
* No horizontal separators like *** or --- unless the Chinese shows stars or another explicit divider.
* Never use bold, italics, or underline formatting.
* No site metadata (e.g. “上一章”, “下一章”, author notes).

## 5. Names & Romanization

* Keep all names in pinyin (e.g. Yang Kai, Su Yan). Add all new names to glossary.
* Never translate names. 
* If some words are found in the Glossary, match the case (for example, Primordial Qi instead of primordial qi)

## 6. Dialogue & Narration

* Dialogue:
* Formal or respectful speech depending on character.
* Modern enough to be smooth in English.
* No archaic English (like “thou” or “thus”), but can be when plot-relevant.
* Still, keep xianxia style dialogue.

* Narration:
* Slightly elevated tone.
* Preserve the original’s descriptive rhythm and weight.
