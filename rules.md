# Martial Peak Translation Rules

## 1. Tone & Style

* Maintain Classic Xianxia tone: formal, dramatic, reverent, but not too much so that it's hard to read.
* Be mindful of rhythm, flow, and tone.
* Clear, natural English that reads smoothly. Use American English if ambiguous.
* Avoid slang or modern idioms.
* Use established xianxia phrases (e.g. “courting death”).
* Watch pronoun clarity carefully.
* Translate all Hanzi — don’t leave anything untranslated.
* Do not flatten the metaphors or tone down insults, harshness, and exaggeration!

## 2. Formatting

* Chapter titles: `## Chapter # — Title`
* One blank line between paragraphs and soft scene shifts.
* No formatting emphasis (no bold, italics, underline).
* No metadata (e.g. 上一章, author notes).
* Only add horizontal separators if present in original.

## 3. Names & Terms

* Never (never!!!) translate chinese measurments of distance or size: Li, Zhang, keep them all or transform into xianxia like measurements.
* Use pinyin for names (e.g. Yang Kai, Su Yan) — never translate names.
* Add new names to glossary.
* Match case for glossary terms (e.g. Primordial Qi, not primordial qi).
* When referring to Stages of cultivation, use Stage instead of Layer

## 4. Dialogue & Narration

* Dialogue:
  * Respectful or formal tone per character.
  * Smooth and modern, but stylistically xianxia.
  * Avoid archaic English unless plot-relevant.
  * Always translate obscene language, do not hide it

* Narration:
  * Slightly elevated tone.
  * Preserve descriptive rhythm and dramatic weight.
